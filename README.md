# An Angular 2.0 todo list application

## Getting Started

 - Clone or download the repo
 - Run `npm install`
 - Run `gulp serve`

This will start a development server and launch your browser to show the application in action. For development I've been using the Atom editor with the **atom-typescript** plugin and **linter-tslint**.
